MERGESORT O(nlog(n))

if size of data is more than one
	split data in half
		merge sort each half
		merge the halves
		~*sorted*~
otherwise data is sorted (one value on its own is sorted)
~*sorted*~

Plaintext-
MERGE
input two sets of sorted data
output one sorted set of data

compare both sets of data
	starting from beginning of both
		compare the first element of each
			insert the lower value into the next available spot in the larger set
		compare the next element from the lower value set with the current greater value element
			insert the lower value into the next available spot of the larger set
		continue until all elements from one of the smaller sets are inserted
			insert remaining values from remaining set
			
			
mergesort: unsorted data
	if unsorted data is only one element
		return data
	
	
	
Pseudocode-
function mergeSort(unsortedData) {
	if unsortedData.length == 1
		return
	if unsortedData.length == 2
		Merge the two values of the data
	else
		data1 = first half of unsorted data
		data2 = second half of unsorted data
		
		mergeSort(data1)
		mergeSort(data2)
		Merge(data1, data2)
